The Lord of the Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien is an epic high-fantasy saga set in the richly imagined world of Middle-earth, where the fate of civilizations turns on the destruction of a single, corrupting artifact: the One Ring. The story follows the humble hobbit Frodo Baggins and a fellowship of diverse companions—men, elves, dwarves, and a wizard—as they journey across vast landscapes of ancient forests, shattered kingdoms, and shadowed mountains to prevent the dark lord Sauron from reclaiming ultimate power. Blending mythic grandeur with intimate moral struggle, the novel explores themes of friendship, sacrifice, temptation, and the endurance of hope against overwhelming darkness.
