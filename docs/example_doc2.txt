AI Engineering (published by O'Reilly Media) is a practical guide to designing, building, and deploying production-grade AI systems. Rather than focusing purely on model theory, the book emphasizes real-world engineering concerns—data pipelines, evaluation, monitoring, scaling, and iteration—showing how machine learning models move from notebooks into reliable, maintainable infrastructure. It covers modern workflows such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), model fine-tuning, prompt engineering, vector databases, and observability, framing AI not as isolated experiments but as continuously evolving systems. The core theme is that successful AI today is as much about software engineering discipline—testing, versioning, deployment, and feedback loops—as it is about model architecture.
