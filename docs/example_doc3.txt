Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a classic romantic novel that explores love, class, reputation, and personal growth in early 19th-century England. The story centers on Elizabeth Bennet, an intelligent and spirited young woman, and her evolving relationship with the reserved and wealthy Mr. Darcy. Through sharp dialogue, social misunderstandings, and moments of self-reflection, Austen examines how pride and prejudice—both personal and societal—can cloud judgment and obstruct happiness. Blending wit, irony, and keen psychological insight, the novel remains a timeless study of character, morality, and the complexities of human relationships.
